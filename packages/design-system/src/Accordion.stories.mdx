The `Accordion` component provides collapsible content sections with accessible keyboard navigation and smooth animations. It allows users to toggle between hiding and showing large amounts of content, making interfaces cleaner and more organized.

Use this component when you need to:
- Present FAQ sections or Q&A content
- Organize lengthy content into digestible sections
- Save vertical space while keeping information accessible
- Create expandable product details or feature lists

The accordion supports both single and multiple item expansion modes. Items consist of a trigger (AccordionTrigger) that users click to reveal the content (AccordionContent), with proper ARIA attributes for screen reader support.
