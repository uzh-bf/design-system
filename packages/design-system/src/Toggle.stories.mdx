The `Toggle` component provides a button-like control that can be pressed and unpressed, maintaining its state between interactions. It's ideal for binary options like formatting toggles, feature switches, or preference controls.

Use this component when you need to:

- Create formatting controls (bold, italic, underline)
- Implement feature toggles or switches
- Provide binary state controls (on/off, enabled/disabled)
- Build toolbar buttons with pressed/unpressed states

The toggle supports different sizes and variants, provides clear visual feedback for its state, and includes proper ARIA attributes for accessibility.
