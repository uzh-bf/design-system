import CycleProgress from './CycleProgress'

{/* START README */}
The CycleProgress component is a circular progress visualization. Additionally, its size, color and children can be overriden and / or customized.

<br />

The props for the CycleProgress component are as follows:

- @param size - Size of the progress bar, can be 'sm' or 'md'
- @param overrideSize - If size adjustments of the relative placement are required due to font changes, this value can be used to override the circle size
- @param percentage - Percentage of the progress bar (0-100)
- @param color - Color of the progress bar (static for the moment)
- @param strokeWidthRem - Width of the progress bar. For small size, a smaller value is recommended
- @param children - Content of the progress bar, displayed in the center
- @param data - Optional data object that can be used for testing (e.g. data-test or data-cy)
- @param className - Optional className object allows you to override the default styling

      Depending on the type of font that was chosen, it is possible that the
      text does not appear centered. In this case, it might be necessary to
      override the size, which is set manually. However, this is explicitely set
      as an override to only be used when necessary. Whenever an override is
      used, the className root will probably also have to be adapted accordingly

        percentage={60}
        overrideSize={40}
